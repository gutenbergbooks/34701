<h3>ACTION OF STEAM ENGINES</h3>


<p>A steam engine is a device by means of which <i>heat</i> is transformed
into <i>work</i>. Work may be defined as the result produced by a force
acting through space, and is commonly measured in foot-pounds; a foot-pound
represents the work done in raising 1 pound 1 foot in height.
The rate of doing work is called <i>power</i>. It has been found by experiment
that there is a definite relation between heat and work, in
the ratio of 1 thermal unit to 778 foot-pounds of work. The number
778 is commonly called the heat equivalent of work or the mechanical
equivalent of heat.</p>

<p>Heat may be transformed into mechanical work through the medium
of steam, by confining a given amount in a closed chamber, and then
allowing it to expand by means of a movable wall (piston) fitted into
one side of the chamber. Heat is given up in the process of expansion,
as shown by the lowered pressure and temperature of the steam, and
work has been done in moving the wall (piston) of the closed chamber
against a resisting force or pressure. When the expansion of steam
takes place without the loss of heat by radiation or conduction, the
relation between the pressure and volume is practically constant; that
is, if a given quantity of steam expands to twice its volume in a closed
chamber of the kind above described, its final pressure will be one-half
that of the initial pressure before expansion took place. A pound of
steam at an absolute pressure of 20 pounds per square inch has a
volume of practically 20 cubic feet, and a temperature of 228 degrees.
If now it be expanded so that its volume is doubled (40 cubic feet),
the pressure will drop to approximately 10 pounds per square inch and
the temperature will be only about 190 degrees. The drop in temperature
is due to the loss of heat which has been transformed into work
in the process of expansion and in moving the wall (piston) of the
chamber against a resisting force, as already noted.</p>


<h3>Principle of the Steam Engine</h3>

<p>The steam engine makes use of a closed chamber with a movable
wall in transforming the heat of steam into mechanical work in the
manner just described. <a href="#Fig01">Fig. 1</a> shows a longitudinal section through
an engine of simple design, and illustrates the principal parts and
their relation to one another.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig01" id="Fig01"></a><img src="images/illo005.jpg" alt="Longitudinal Section through
the Ames High-speed Engine" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 1. Longitudinal Section through the Ames High-speed Engine</p></div>

<p>The cylinder <i>A</i> is the closed chamber in which expansion takes
place, and the piston <i>B</i>, the movable wall. The cylinder is of cast
iron, accurately bored and finished to a circular cross-section. The
piston is carefully fitted to slide easily in the cylinder, being made
practically steam tight by means of packing rings. The work generated
in moving the piston is transferred to the crank-pin <i>H</i> by means<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
of the piston-rod <i>C</i>, and the connecting-rod <i>F</i>. The piston-rod passes
out of the cylinder through a stuffing box, which prevents the leakage
of steam around it. The cross-head <i>D</i> serves to guide the piston-rod in
a straight line, and also contains the wrist-pin <i>E</i> which joins the piston-rod
and connecting-rod. The cross-head slides upon the guide-plate
<i>G</i>, which causes it to move in an accurate line, and at the same time
takes the downward thrust from the connecting-rod.</p>

<p>The crank-pin is connected with the main shaft <i>I</i> by means of a
crank arm, which in this case is made in the form of a disk in order to
give a better balance. The balance wheel or flywheel <i>J</i> carries the
crank past the dead centers at the ends of the stroke, and gives a uniform
motion to the shaft. The various parts of the engine are carried
on a rigid bed <i>K</i>, usually of cast iron, which in turn is bolted to a
foundation of brick or concrete. The power developed is taken off by
means of a belted pulley attached to the main shaft, or, in certain
cases, in the form of electrical energy from a direct-connected dynamo.</p>

<p>When in action, a certain amount of steam (<span class="enum">1</span>&#8260;<span class="denom">4</span>
to <span class="enum">1</span>&#8260;<span class="denom">3</span> of the total
cylinder volume in simple engines) is admitted to one end of the
cylinder, while the other is open to the atmosphere. The steam forces
the piston forward a certain distance by its direct action at the boiler
pressure. After the supply is shut off, the forward movement of the
piston is continued to the end of the stroke by the expansion of the
steam. Steam is now admitted to the other end of the cylinder, and
the operation repeated on the backward or return stroke.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig02" id="Fig02"></a><img src="images/illo006.jpg" alt="Section of Cylinder, showing Slide Valve" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 2. Section of Cylinder, showing Slide Valve</p></div>

<p>An enlarged section of the cylinder showing the action of the valve
for admitting and exhausting the steam is shown in <a href="#Fig02">Fig. 2</a>. In this
case the piston is shown in its extreme backward position, ready for
the forward stroke. The steam chest <i>L</i> is filled with steam at boiler
pressure, which is being admitted to the narrow space back of the
piston through the valve <i>N</i>, as indicated by the arrows. The exhaust
port <i>M</i> is in communication with the other end of the cylinder and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
allows the piston to move forward without resistance, except that due
to the piston-rod, which transfers the work done by the expanding
steam to the crank-pin. The valve <i>N</i> is operated automatically by a
crank or eccentric attached to the main shaft, and opens and closes
the supply and exhaust ports at the proper time to secure the results
described.</p>


<h3>Work Diagram</h3>

<p>Having discussed briefly the general principle upon which an engine
operates, the next step is to study more carefully the transformation
of heat into work within the cylinder, and to become familiar with the
graphical methods of representing it. Work has already been defined
as the result of force acting through space, and the unit of work as the
foot-pound, which is the work done in raising 1 pound 1 foot in height.
For example, it requires 1&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;1 = 1 foot-pound to raise 1 pound 1 foot,
or 1&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10 = 10 foot-pounds to raise 1 pound 10 feet, or 10&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;1 = 10
foot-pounds to raise 10 pounds 1 foot, or 10&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10 = 100 foot-pounds
to raise 10 pounds 10 feet, etc. That is, the product of weight or force
acting, times the distance moved through, represents work; and if the
force is taken in pounds and the distance in feet, the result will be
in foot-pounds. This result may be shown graphically by a figure
called a work diagram.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig03" id="Fig03"></a><img src="images/illo007a.png" alt="A Simple Work Diagram" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 3. A Simple Work Diagram</p></div>

<p>In <a href="#Fig03">Fig. 3</a>, let distances on the line <i>OY</i> represent the force acting, and
distances on <i>OX</i> represent the space moved through. Suppose the figure
to be drawn to such a scale that <i>OY</i> is 5 feet in height, and <i>OX</i> 10
feet long. Let each division on <i>OY</i> represent 1 pound pressure, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
each division on <i>OX</i> 1 foot of space moved through. If a pressure of
5 pounds acts through a distance of 10 feet, then an amount of 5&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10
= 50 foot-pounds of work has been done. Referring to <a href="#Fig03">Fig. 3</a>, it is
evident that the height <i>OY</i> (the pressure acting), multiplied by the
length <i>OX</i> (the distance moved through), gives 5&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10 = 50 square
feet, which is the area of the rectangle <i>YCXO</i>; that is, the area of a
rectangle may represent work done, if the height represents a force
acting, and the length the distance moved through. If the diagram
were drawn to a smaller scale so that the divisions were 1 inch in
length instead of 1 foot, the area <i>YCXO</i> would still represent the work
done, except each square inch would equal 1 foot-pound instead of each
square foot, as in the present illustration.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig04" id="Fig04"></a><img src="images/illo007b.png" alt="Another Form of Work Diagram" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 4. Another Form of Work Diagram</p></div>

<p>In <a href="#Fig04">Fig. 4</a> the diagram, instead of being rectangular in form, takes a
different shape on account of different forces acting at different periods
over the distance moved through. In the first case (<a href="#Fig03">Fig. 3</a>), a uniform
force of 5 pounds acts through a distance of 10 feet, and produces 5&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10
= 50 foot-pounds of work. In the second case (<a href="#Fig04">Fig. 4</a>), forces of 5
pounds, 4 pounds, 3 pounds, 2 pounds, and 1 pound, act through distances
of 2 feet each, and produce (5&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;2) + (4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;2) + (3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;2) +
(2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;2) + (1&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;2) = 30 foot-pounds. This is also the area, in square
feet, of the figure <i>Y54321XO</i>, which is made up of the areas of the
five small rectangles shown by the dotted lines. Another way of finding
the total area of the figure shown in <a href="#Fig04">Fig. 4</a>, and determining
the work<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
done, is to multiply the length by the average of the heights of the
small rectangles. The average height is found by adding the several
heights and dividing the sum by their number, as follows:</p>

<table class="formula" summary="Formula p07-1">

<tr>
<td>5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td>
<td>&nbsp;= 3, and 3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10 = 30 square feet, as before.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>This, then, means that the average force acting throughout the stroke
is 3 pounds, and the total work done is 3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10 = 30 foot-pounds.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig05" id="Fig05"></a><img src="images/illo008.png" alt="Work Diagram when Pressure drops Uniformly" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 5. Work Diagram when Pressure drops Uniformly</p></div>

<p>In <a href="#Fig05">Fig. 5</a> the pressure drops uniformly from 5 pounds at the beginning
to 0 at the end of the stroke. In this case also the area and
work done are found by multiplying the length of the diagram by the
average height, as follows:</p>

<table class="formula" summary="Formula p07-1">

<tr>
<td>5 + 0</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td>
<td>&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10 = 25 square feet,</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>or 25 foot-pounds of work done.</p>

<p>The object of <a href="#Fig03">Figs. 3</a>, <a href="#Fig04">4</a> and <a href="#Fig05">5</a> is to show how foot-pounds of work
may be represented graphically by the areas of diagrams, and also to
make it clear that this remains true whatever the form of the diagram.
It is also evident that knowing the area, the average height or pressure
may be found by dividing by the length, and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig06" id="Fig06"></a><img src="images/illo009.png" alt="The Ideal Work Diagram of a Steam Engine" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 6. The Ideal Work Diagram of a Steam Engine</p></div>

<p><a href="#Fig06">Fig. 6</a> shows the form of work diagram which would be produced by
the action of the steam in an engine cylinder, if no heat were lost by
conduction and radiation. Starting with the piston in the position
shown in <a href="#Fig02">Fig. 2</a>, steam is admitted at a pressure represented by the
height of the line <i>OY</i>. As the piston moves forward, sufficient steam
is admitted to maintain the same pressure. At the point <i>B</i> the valve
closes and steam is cut off. The work done up to this time is shown
by the rectangle <i>YBbO</i>. From the point <i>B</i> to the end of the stroke <i>C</i>,
the piston is moved forward by the expansion of the steam, the pressure
falling in proportion to the distance moved through, until at the
end of the stroke it is represented by the vertical line <i>CX</i>. At the
point <i>C</i> the exhaust valve opens and the pressure drops to 0 (atmospheric
pressure in this case).</p>

<p>As it is always desirable to find the work done by a complete stroke
of the engine, it is necessary to find the average or mean pressure <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>acting
throughout the stroke. This can only be done by determining the
area of the diagram and dividing by the length of the stroke. This
gives what is called the mean ordinate, which multiplied by the scale
of the drawing, will give the mean or average pressure. For example,
if the area of the diagram is found to be 6 square inches, and its
length is 3 inches, the mean ordinate will be 6&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;3 = 2 inches. If the
diagram is drawn to such a scale that 1 inch on <i>OY</i> represents 10
pounds, then the average or mean pressure will be 2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10 = 20 pounds,
and this multiplied by the actual length of the piston stroke will give
the work done in foot-pounds. The practical application of the above,
together with the method of obtaining steam engine indicator diagrams
and measuring the areas of the same, will be taken up in detail under
the heading of Steam Engine Testing.</p>


<h3>Definitions Relating to Engine Diagrams</h3>

<p>Before taking up the construction of an actual engine diagram, it is
first necessary to become familiar with certain terms which are used in
connection with it.</p>

<p><i>Cut-off.</i>&mdash;The cut-off is the point in the stroke at which the admission
valve closes and the expansion of steam begins.</p>

<p><i>Ratio of Expansion.</i>&mdash;This is the reciprocal of the cut-off, that is, if
the cut-off is <span class="enum">1</span>&#8260;<span class="denom">4</span>, the ratio of expansion is 4. In other words, it is
the ratio of the final volume of the steam at the end of the stroke to its
volume at the point of cut-off. For example, a cylinder takes steam
at boiler pressure until the piston has moved one-fourth the length of
its stroke; the valve now closes and expansion takes place until the
stroke is completed. The one-fourth cylinderful of steam has become
a cylinderful, that is, it has expanded to four times its original volume,
and the ratio of expansion is said to be 4.</p>

<p><i>Point of Release.</i>&mdash;This is the point in the stroke at which the exhaust
valve opens and relieves the pressure acting on the piston. This
takes place just before the end of the stroke in order to reduce the
shock when the piston changes its direction of travel.</p>

<p><i>Compression.</i>&mdash;This acts in connection with the premature release in
order to reduce the shock at the end of the stroke. During the forward
stroke of an engine the exhaust valve in front of the piston remains
open as shown in <a href="#Fig02">Fig. 2</a>. Shortly before the end of the
stroke<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
this closes, leaving a certain amount of steam in the cylinder. The
continuation of the stroke compresses this steam, and by raising its
pressure forms a cushion, which, in connection with the removal of
the pressure back of the piston by release, brings the piston to a stop
and causes it to reverse its direction without shock. High-speed engines
require a greater amount of compression than those running at
low speed.</p>

<p><i>Clearance</i>.&mdash;This is the space between the cylinder head and the piston
when the latter is at the end of its stroke; it also includes that
portion of the steam port between the valve and the cylinder. Clearance
is usually expressed as a percentage of the piston-displacement
of the cylinder, and varies in different types of engines. The following
table gives approximate values for engines of different design.</p>

<p>A large clearance is evidently objectionable because it represents a
space which must be filled with steam at boiler pressure at the beginning
of each stroke, and from which but a comparatively small amount
of work is obtained. As compression increases, the amount of steam
required to fill the clearance space diminishes, but on the other hand,
increasing the compression reduces the mean effective pressure.</p>

<p><i>Initial Pressure.</i>&mdash;This is the pressure in the cylinder up to the point
of cut-off. It is usually slightly less than boiler pressure owing to
&#8220;wire-drawing&#8221; in the steam pipe and ports.</p>

<p><i>Terminal Pressure.</i>&mdash;This is the pressure in the cylinder at the time
release occurs, and depends upon the initial pressure, the ratio of expansion,
and the amount of cylinder condensation.</p>

<p><i>Back Pressure.</i>&mdash;This is the pressure in the cylinder when the
exhaust port is open, and is that against which the piston is forced
during the working stroke. For example, in <a href="#Fig02">Fig. 2</a> the small space at
the left of the piston is filled with steam at initial pressure, while the
space at the right of the piston is exposed to the back pressure. The
working pressure varies throughout the stroke, due to the expansion
of the steam, while the back pressure remains constant, except for the
effect of compression at the end of the stroke. The theoretical back
pressure in a non-condensing engine (one exhausting into the atmosphere)
is that of the atmosphere or 14.7 pounds per square inch above
a vacuum, but in actual practice it is about 2 pounds above atmospheric
pressure, or 17 pounds absolute, due to the resistance of exhaust
ports and connecting pipes. In the case of a condensing engine (one
exhausting into a condenser) the back pressure depends upon the efficiency
of the condenser, averaging about 3 pounds absolute pressure
in the best practice.</p>

<p><i>Effective Pressure.</i>&mdash;This is the difference between the pressure on
the steam side of the piston and that on the exhaust side, or in other
words, the difference between the working pressure and the back<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
pressure. This value varies throughout the stroke with the expansion
of the steam.</p>

<p><i>Mean Effective Pressure.</i>&mdash;It has just been stated that the effective
pressure varies throughout the stroke. The mean effective pressure
(M. E. P.) is the average of all the effective pressures, and this average
multiplied by the length of stroke, gives the work done per stroke.</p>

<p><i>Line of Absolute Vacuum.</i>&mdash;In the diagram shown in <a href="#Fig06">Fig. 6</a>, the line
<i>OX</i> is the line of absolute vacuum; that is, it is assumed that there
is no pressure on the exhaust side of the piston. In other words, the
engine is exhausting into a perfect vacuum.</p>

<p><i>Atmospheric Line.</i>&mdash;This is a line drawn parallel to the line of absolute
vacuum at such a distance above it as to represent 14.7 pounds
pressure per square inch, according to the scale used.</p>


<h3>Construction of Ideal Diagram</h3>

<p class="caption">Fig. 7. Constructing a Steam Engine Work Diagram</p></div>

<p>One of the first steps in the design of a steam engine is the construction
of an ideal diagram, and the engine is planned to produce this as
nearly as possible when in operation. First assume the initial pressure,
the ratio of expansion, and the percentage of clearance, for the type
of engine under consideration. Draw lines <i>OX</i> and <i>OY</i> at right angles
as in <a href="#Fig07">Fig. 7</a>. Make <i>OR</i> the same percentage of the stroke that the
clearance is of the piston displacement; make <i>RX</i> equal to the length
of the stroke (on a reduced scale). Erect the perpendicular <i>RA</i> of
such a height that it shall represent, to scale, an absolute pressure per
square inch equal to 0.95 of the boiler pressure. Draw in the dotted
lines <i>AK</i> and <i>KX</i>, and the atmospheric line <i>LH</i> at a height above <i>OX</i>
to represent 14.7 pounds per square inch. Locate the point of cut-off,
<i>B</i>, according to the assumed ratio of expansion. Points on the expansion
curve <i>BC</i> are found as follows: Divide the distance <i>BK</i> into
any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
number of equal spaces, as shown by <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, etc., and connect them
with the point <i>O</i>. Through the points of intersection with <i>BP</i>, as <i>a&acute;</i>,
<i>b&acute;</i>, <i>c&acute;</i>, <i>d&acute;</i>, etc., draw horizontal lines,
and through <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, etc., draw
vertical lines. The intersection of corresponding horizontal and vertical
lines will be points on the theoretical expansion line. If the engine
is to be non-condensing, the theoretical work, or indicator diagram,
as it is called, will be bounded by the lines <i>ABCHG</i>.</p>

<p>The actual diagram will vary somewhat from the theoretical, as
shown by the shaded lines. The admission line between <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>
will slant downward slightly, and the point of cut-off will be rounded,
owing to the slow closing of the valve. The first half of the expansion
line will fall below the theoretical, owing to a drop in pressure caused
by cylinder condensation, but the actual line will rise above the theoretical
in the latter part of the stroke on account of re-evaporation, due
to heat given out by the hot cylinder walls to the low-pressure steam.
Instead of the pressure dropping abruptly at <i>C</i>, release takes place
just before the end of the stroke, and the diagram is rounded at <i>CF</i>
instead of having sharp corners. The back pressure line <i>FD</i> is drawn
slightly above the atmospheric line, a distance to represent about 2
pounds per square inch. At <i>D</i> the exhaust valve closes and compression
begins, rounding the bottom of the diagram up to <i>E</i>.</p>

<p>The area of the actual diagram, as shown by the shaded lines in <a href="#Fig07">Fig.
7</a>, will be smaller than the theoretical, in about the following ratio:</p>

<p>Large medium-speed engines, 0.90 of theoretical area.<br />
Small medium-speed engines, 0.85 of theoretical area.<br />
High-speed engines, 0.75 of theoretical area.</p>

<h3>RATING AND GENERAL PROPORTIONS OF STEAM ENGINES</h3>


<p>The capacity or power of a steam engine is rated in horsepower, one
horsepower (H. P.) being the equivalent of 33,000 foot-pounds of work
done per minute. The horsepower of a given engine may be computed
by the formula:</p>

</table>

<p>The derivation of the above formula is easily explained, as follows:
The area of the piston, in square inches, multiplied by the mean
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>effective
pressure, in pounds per square inch, gives the total force acting on
the piston, in pounds. The length of stroke, in feet, times the number
of strokes per minute gives the distance the piston moves through,
in feet per minute. It has already been shown that the pressure in
pounds multiplied by the distance moved through in feet, gives the
foot-pounds of work done. Hence, <i>A</i>&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;<i>P</i>&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;<i>L</i>&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;<i>N</i>
gives the foot-pounds
of work done per minute by a steam engine. If one horsepower
is represented by 33,000 foot-pounds per minute, the power or rating
of the engine will be obtained by dividing the total foot-pounds of work
done per minute by 33,000. For ease in remembering the formula
given, it is commonly written</p>

<p>The absolute initial pressure is 90 + 15 = 105 pounds. The factor
for 3 per cent clearance and <span class="enum">1</span>&#8260;<span class="denom">3</span> cut-off, from
<a href="#TabII">Table II</a>, is 0.71. Applying

inch.</p>

<p><i>Example 2</i>:&mdash;A condensing engine has a clearance of 5 per cent. It is
supplied with steam at 140 pounds gage pressure, and has a ratio of
expansion of 6. What is the M. E. P.?</p>

<p>The absolute initial pressure is 140 + 15 = 155. The factor for a
ratio of expansion of 6 (<span class="enum">1</span>&#8260;<span class="denom">6</span> cut-off) and 5 per cent clearance is 0.5,

<p>The power of an engine computed by the method just explained is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
called the indicated horsepower (I. H. P.), and gives the total power
developed, including that required to overcome the friction of the engine
itself. The delivered or brake horsepower (B. H. P.) is that
delivered by the engine after deducting from the indicated horsepower
the power required to operate the moving parts. The brake horsepower
commonly varies from 80 to 90 per cent of the indicated horsepower
at full load, depending upon the type and size of engine.</p>

<p>In proportioning an engine cylinder for any given horsepower, the
designer usually has the following data, either given or assumed, for
the special type of engine under consideration: Initial pressure, back
pressure, clearance, cut-off, and piston speed.</p>

<p>These quantities vary in different types of engines, but in the absence
of more specific data the values in <a href="#TabIII">Table III</a> will be found useful.
The back pressure may be taken as 17 pounds per square inch,
absolute, for non-condensing engines, and as 3 pounds for condensing
engines as previously stated.</p>

<p>The first step in proportioning the cylinder is to compute the approximate
mean effective pressure from the assumed initial pressure,
clearance, and cut-off, by the method already explained. Next assume
the piston speed for the type of engine to be designed, and determine
the piston area by the following formula:</p>

<p>This formula usually gives the diameter of the piston in inches and
fractions of an inch, while it is desirable to make this dimension an
even number of inches. This may be done by taking as the diameter
the nearest whole number, and changing the piston speed to correspond.
This is done by the use of the following equation.</p>

then be <span class="enum">(2<i>A</i> - <i>a</i>)</span>&#8260;<span class="denom">2</span>,

This latter area must be assumed. After assuming a new piston
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>diameter
of even inches, its effective or average area must be used in determining
the new piston speed. The length of stroke is commonly
proportioned to the diameter of cylinder, and the piston speed divided
by this will give the number of strokes per minute.</p>

<p><i>Example</i>:&mdash;Find the diameter of cylinder, length of stroke, and revolutions

<h3>STEAM ENGINE DETAILS</h3>


<p>Some of the most important details of a steam engine are those of its
valve gear. The simplest form of valve is that known as the plain
slide valve, and as nearly all others are a modification of this, it is
essential that the designer should first familiarize himself with this
particular type of valve in all its details of operation. After this has
been done, a study of other forms of valves will be found a comparatively
easy matter. The so called Corliss valve differs radically
from the slide valve, but the results to be obtained and the terms used
in its design are practically the same. The valve gear of a steam
engine is made up of the valve or valves which admit steam to and
exhaust it from the cylinder, and of the mechanism which governs the
valve movements, the latter usually consisting of one or more eccentrics
attached to the main shaft.</p>


<h3>The Slide Valve</h3>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig08" id="Fig08"></a><img src="images/illo016.png" alt="Longitudinal Section of Slide Valve with Ports" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 8. Longitudinal Section of Slide Valve with Ports</p></div>

<p><a href="#Fig08">Fig. 8</a> shows a longitudinal section of a slide valve with the ports,
bridges, etc. The valve is shown in mid-position in order that certain
points relating to it may be more easily understood. The valve, <i>V</i>, consists
of a hollow casting, with ends projecting beyond the ports as
shown; the lower face is smoothly finished and fitted to the valve seat
<i>AB</i>. In operation it slides back and forth, opening and closing the
ports which connect the steam chest with the cylinder. Steam is admitted
to the cylinder when either port <i>CD</i> or <i>DC</i> is opened, and is released
when the ports are brought into communication with the exhaust
port <i>MN</i>. This is accomplished by the movement of the valve,
which brings one of the cylinder ports and the exhaust port both under
the hollow arch <i>K</i>. The portions <i>DM</i> and <i>ND</i> of the valve seat are
called the bridges.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig09" id="Fig09"></a><img src="images/illo017a.png" alt="Illustration showing Lead of Slide Valve" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 9. Illustration showing Lead of Slide Valve</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>It
will be seen by reference to <a href="#Fig08">Fig. 8</a> that the portions <i>OI</i> and <i>IO</i>
are wider than the ports which they cover. This extra width is called
the <i>lap</i>, <i>OC</i> being the outside lap and <i>DI</i> the inside or exhaust lap.
The object of outside lap is that the steam may be shut off after the
piston has moved forward a certain distance, and be expanded during
the remainder of the stroke. If there were no outside lap, steam would
be admitted throughout the entire stroke and there would be no expansion.
If there were no inside lap, exhaust would take place throughout
the whole stroke, and the advantages of premature release and
compression would be lost. Hence, outside lap affects the cut-off, and
inside lap affects release and compression. A valve has <i>lead</i> when it
begins to uncover the steam port before the end of the return stroke
of the piston. This is shown in <a href="#Fig09">Fig. 9</a>, where the piston <i>P</i> is just ready
to start on its forward stroke as indicated by the arrow. The valve has
already opened a distance equal to the lead, and the steam has had an
opportunity to enter and fill the clearance space before the beginning
of the stroke. The lead varies in different engines, being greater in
high-speed than in low-speed types.</p>

<h3>The Eccentric</h3>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig10" id="Fig10"></a><img src="images/illo017b.png" alt="Diagrammatical View of Eccentric" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 10. Diagrammatical View of Eccentric</p></div>

<div class="figleft"><a name="Fig11" id="Fig11"></a><img src="images/illo018.png" alt="Relations of Crank and Eccentric" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 11. Relations of Crank and Eccentric</p></div>

<p>The slide valve is usually driven by an eccentric attached to the
main shaft. A diagram of an eccentric is shown in <a href="#Fig10">Fig. 10</a>. An eccentric
is, in reality, a short crank with a crank-pin of such size that it
surrounds the shaft. The arm of a crank is the distance between the
center of the shaft, and the center of the crank-pin. The throw of an
eccentric corresponds to this, and is the distance between the center of
the shaft and the center of the eccentric disk, as shown at <i>a</i> in <a href="#Fig10">Fig. 10</a>.
The disk is keyed to the shaft, and as the shaft revolves, the center of
the disk rotates about it as shown by the dotted line, and gives a forward
and backward movement
to the valve rod equal to twice
the throw <i>a</i>.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig11">Fig. 11</a> let <i>A</i> represent the
center of the main shaft, <i>B</i> the
crank-pin to which the connecting-rod
is attached (see <i>H</i>, <a href="#Fig01">
1</a>), and the dotted circle through
<i>B</i> the path of the crank-pin
around the shaft. For simplicity,
let the eccentric be represented
in a similar manner by
the crank <i>Ab</i>, and its path by
the dotted circle through <i>b</i>. <a href="#Fig12">Fig.
12</a> shows a similar diagram
with the piston <i>P</i> and the valve
in the positions corresponding
to the positions of the crank and
eccentric in <a href="#Fig11">Fig. 11</a>, and in the
diagram at the right in <a href="#Fig12">Fig. 12</a>.
The piston is at the extreme left,
ready to start on its forward
stroke toward the right. The
crank-pin <i>B</i> is at its extreme inner
position. When the valve is
at its mid-position, as in <a href="#Fig08">Fig. 8</a>, the eccentric arm <i>Ab</i> will coincide with
the line <i>AC</i>, <a href="#Fig11">Fig. 11</a>. If the eccentric is turned on the shaft sufficiently
to bring the left-hand edge <i>O</i>, <a href="#Fig08">Fig. 8</a>, of the valve in line with the edge
<i>C</i> of the port, the arm of the eccentric will have moved from its
vertical position to that shown by the line <i>Ab&acute;</i> in <a href="#Fig11">Fig. 11</a>. The angle
through which the eccentric has been turned from the vertical to bring
about this result is called the <i>angular advance</i>, and is shown by angle
<i>CAb&acute;</i> in <a href="#Fig11">Fig. 11</a>. The angular advance evidently depends upon the
amount of lap.</p>

<p>If the valve is to be given a lead, as indicated in <a href="#Fig12">Fig. 12</a>, the eccentric
must be turned still further on the shaft to open the valve slightly
before the piston starts on its forward movement. This brings the
eccentric to the position <i>Ab</i> shown in <a href="#Fig11">Fig. 11</a>. The angle through
which the eccentric is turned to give the necessary lead opening to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
valve is called the <i>angle of lead</i>, and is shown by angle <i>b&acute;Ab</i>. By reference
to <a href="#Fig11">Fig. 11</a>, it is seen that the total angle between the crank
and the eccentric is 90 degrees, plus the angular advance, plus the
angle of lead. This is the total angle of advance.</p>

<p>The relative positions of the piston and valve at different periods of
the stroke are illustrated in <a href="#ValveAction">Figs. 12 to 16</a>. <a href="#Fig12">Fig. 12</a> shows the piston
just beginning the forward stroke, the valve having uncovered the admission
port an amount equal to the lead. The crank is in a horizontal
position, and the eccentric has moved from the vertical an amount
sufficient to move the valve toward the right a distance equal to the
outside lap plus the lead. The arrows show that steam is entering
the left-hand port and is being exhausted through the right-hand
port.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>In
<a href="#Fig13">Fig. 13</a> it is seen that the valve has traveled forward sufficiently
to open the steam port to its fullest extent, and the piston has moved
to the point indicated. The exhaust port is still wide open, and the
relative positions of the crank and eccentric are shown in the diagram
at the right. In <a href="#Fig14">Fig. 14</a> the eccentric has passed the horizontal position
and the valve has started on its backward stroke, while the piston
is still moving forward. The admission port is closed, cut-off having
taken place, and the steam is expanding. The exhaust port is still
partially open.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig15">Fig. 15</a> both ports are closed and compression is taking place in
front of the piston while expansion continues back of it. Release occurs
in <a href="#Fig16">Fig. 16</a> just before the piston reaches the end of its stroke.
The eccentric crank is now in a vertical position, pointing downward,
and exhaust is just beginning to take place through the left-hand port.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
This completes the different stages of a single stroke, the same features
being repeated upon the return of the piston to its original position.
The conditions of lap, lead, angular advance, etc., pertain to practically
all valves, whatever their design.</p>


<h3>Different Types of Valves</h3>

<p>In the following are shown some of the valves in common use, being,
with the exception of the Corliss, modifications of the plain slide valve,
and similar in their action.</p>

<p><i>Double-Ported Balanced Valve.</i>&mdash;A valve of this type has already been
shown in <a href="#Fig02">Fig. 2</a>. This valve is flat in form, with two
finished surfaces,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
and works between the valve-seat and a plate, the latter being prevented
from pressing against the valve by special bearing surfaces
which hold it about 0.002 inch away. The construction of the valve is
such that when open the steam reaches the port through two openings
as indicated by the arrows at the left. The object of this is to reduce
the motion of the valve and quicken its action in admitting and cutting
off steam.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig17" id="Fig17"></a><img src="images/illo021b.png" alt="Engine with Piston Valve" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 17. Engine with Piston Valve</p></div>

<p><i>Piston Valve.</i>&mdash;The piston valve shown in <a href="#Fig17">Fig. 17</a> is identical in its
action with the plain slide valve shown in <a href="#Fig08">Fig. 8</a>, except that it is
circular in section instead of being flat or rectangular. The advantage
claimed for this type of valve is the greater ease in fitting cylindrical
surfaces as compared with flat ones. The valve slides in special<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
bushings which may be renewed when worn. Piston valves are also made
with double ports.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig18" id="Fig18"></a><img src="images/illo022a.jpg" alt="Section through Cylinder of Engine of
the Four-valve Type" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 18. Section through Cylinder of Engine of the Four-valve Type</p></div>

<p><i>Four-Valve Type.</i>&mdash;<a href="#Fig18">Fig. 18</a> shows a horizontal section through the
cylinder and valves of an engine of the four-valve type. The admission
valves are shown at the top of the illustration and the exhaust valves at
the bottom, although, in reality, they are at the sides of the cylinder.
The advantage of an arrangement of this kind is that the valves may
be set independently of each other and the work done by the two ends<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
of the cylinder equalized. The various events, such as cut-off, compression,
etc., may be adjusted without regard to each other, and in such
a manner as to give the best results, a condition which is not possible
with a single valve.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig19" id="Fig19"></a><img src="images/illo022b.png" alt="Different Types of Corliss Valves" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 19. Different Types of Corliss Valves</p></div>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig21" id="Fig21"></a><img src="images/illo023b.png" alt="The Gridiron Valve" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 21. The Gridiron Valve</p></div>

<p><i>Gridiron Valve.</i>&mdash;One of the principal objects sought in the design of
a valve is quick action at the points of admission and cut-off. This
requires the uncovering of a large port opening with a comparatively
small travel of the valve. The gridiron valve shown in <a href="#Fig21">Fig. 21</a> is
constructed especially for this purpose. This valve is of the four-valve
type, one steam valve and one exhaust valve being shown in the section.
Both the valve and its seat contain a number of narrow openings
or ports, so that a short movement of the valve will open or close a
comparatively large opening. For example, the steam valve in the
illustration has 12 openings, so that if they are <span class="enum">1</span>&#8260;<span class="denom">4</span> inch in width each,
a movement of <span class="enum">1</span>&#8260;<span class="denom">4</span>
inch of the valve will open a space 12&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;<span class="enum">1</span>&#8260;<span class="denom">4</span> = 3
inches in length.</p>

<p><i>Corliss Valve.</i>&mdash;A section through an engine cylinder equipped with
Corliss valves is shown in <a href="#Fig20">Fig. 20</a>. There are four cylindrical valves in
this type of engine, two steam valves at the top and two exhaust valves
at the bottom. This arrangement is used to secure proper drainage.
The action of the admission and exhaust valves is indicated by the arrows,
the upper left-hand and the lower right-hand valve being open
and the other two closed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

C, Reach Rod; D, Radial Arm; E, Steam Valve; F, Bell-crank; G, Wrist Plate;<br />
H, Exhaust Valve; K, Dash-pot</p></div>

<p>Side and sectional views of different forms of this type of valve are
shown in <a href="#Fig19">Fig. 19</a>. They are operated by means of short crank-arms
which are attached to a wrist-plate by means of radial arms or rods,
as shown in <a href="#Fig22">Fig. 22</a>. The wrist-plate, in turn, is given a partial backward
and forward rotation by means of an eccentric attached to the
main shaft and connected to the upper part of the wrist-plate by a rod
as indicated. The exhaust valves are both opened and closed by the
action of the wrist-plate and connecting rods. The steam valves are
opened in this manner, but are closed by the suction of dash pots attached
to the drop levers on the valve stems by means of vertical rods,
as shown.</p>

<p class="caption">Figs. 23 to 26. Action of Corliss Valve Gear</p>

<p>The action of the steam or admission valves is best explained by reference
to <a href="#CorlissValve">Figs. 23 to 26</a>. Referring to <a href="#Fig23">Fig. 23</a>, <i>A</i> is a bell-crank which
turns loosely upon the valve stem <i>V</i>. The lower left-hand extension
of <i>A</i> carries the grab hook <i>H</i>, while the upper extension is connected
with the wrist-plate as indicated. Ordinarily the hook <i>H</i> is
pressed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
inward by the spring <i>S</i>, so that the longer arm of the hook is always
pressed against the knock-off cam <i>C</i>. The cam <i>C</i> also turns upon the
valve stem <i>V</i> and is connected with the governor by means of a reach
rod as indicated in <a href="#Fig23">Fig. 23</a> and shown in <a href="#Fig22">Fig. 22</a>. The drop lever <i>B</i> is
keyed to the valve stem <i>V</i>, and is connected with the dash pot by a rod
as indicated by the dotted line. This is also shown in <a href="#Fig22">Fig. 22</a>. The
end of the drop lever carries a steel block (shown shaded in <a href="#Fig23">Fig. 23</a>),
which engages with the grab hook <i>H</i>.</p>

<div class="figleft"><a name="Fig27" id="Fig27"></a><img src="images/illo026.png" alt="Governor for Corliss Engine" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 27. Governor for Corliss Engine</p></div>

<p>When in operation, the bell-crank is rotated in the direction of the
arrow by the action of the wrist-plate and connecting-rod. As the
bell-crank rotates, the grab hook engages the steel block at the end of
the drop lever <i>B</i> and lifts it, thus causing the valve to open, and to
remain so until the bell-crank has advanced so far that the longer arm
of the grab hook <i>H</i> is pressed outward by the projection on the
knock-off cam, as shown in <a href="#Fig24">Fig. 24</a>. The drop lever now being released,
the valve is quickly closed by the suction of the dash pot, which pulls
the lever down to its original position by means of the rod previously
mentioned.</p>

<div class="figright"><a name="Fig28" id="Fig28"></a><img src="images/illo027a.png" alt="Dash-pot for Corliss Engine" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 28. Dash-pot for Corliss Engine</p></div>

<p>The governor operates by changing the point of cut-off through the
action of the cam <i>C</i>. With the cam in the position shown in <a href="#Fig25">Fig. 25</a>,
cut-off occurs earlier than in <a href="#Fig24">Fig. 24</a>. Should the cam be turned in
the opposite direction (clockwise), cut-off would take place later. A
detailed view of the complete valve mechanism described is shown assembled
in <a href="#Fig26">Fig. 26</a>, with each part properly named. A detail of the
governor is shown in <a href="#Fig27">Fig. 27</a>. An increase in speed causes the revolving
balls <i>BB</i> to swing outward, thus raising the weight <i>W</i> and the
sleeve <i>S</i>. This in turn operates the lever <i>L</i> through rod <i>R</i> and a bell-crank
attachment, as shown in the right-hand view. An upward and
downward movement of the balls, due to a change in speed of the
engine, swings the lever <i>L</i> backward and forward as shown by the<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span> full and dotted lines. The ends of this
lever are attached by means of reach-rods to the knock-off cams, this
being shown more clearly in <a href="#Fig22">Fig. 22</a>. The connections between the lever
<i>L</i> and cam <i>C</i> are such that a raising of the balls, due to increased
speed, will reduce the cut-off and thus slow down the engine. On the
other hand, a falling of the balls will lengthen the cut-off through the
same mechanism.</p>

<p>Mention has already
been made of the dash
pot which is used to
close the valve suddenly
after being released
from the grab hook.
The dash-pot rod is
shown in <a href="#Fig26">Fig. 26</a>, and
indicated by dotted
lines in <a href="#Fig23">Figs. 23</a> to <a href="#Fig25">25</a>.
A detailed view of one
form of dash pot is
shown in <a href="#Fig28">Fig. 28</a>. When
the valve is opened, the rod attached to lever <i>B</i>, <a href="#Fig23">Figs. 23</a> and <a href="#Fig24">24</a>,
raises the piston <i>P</i>, <a href="#Fig28">Fig. 28</a>, and a partial vacuum is formed beneath
it which draws the piston and connecting rod down by suction as soon
as the lever <i>B</i> is released, and thus closes the valve suddenly and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27"
id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>without
shock. The strength of the suction and the air cushion for this
piston are regulated by the inlet and outlet valves shown on the sides
of the dash pot.</p>

<p>A partial cross-section of an adjustable piston is shown in <a href="#Fig29">Fig. 29</a>,
and a longitudinal section of the same piston in <a href="#Fig30">Fig. 30</a>. The principal
feature to be emphasized is the method of automatic expansion employed
to take up any wear and keep the piston tight. In setting up
the piston a hand adjustment is made of the outer sleeve or ring <i>R</i>
by means of the set-screws <i>AA</i>. Ring <i>R</i> is made in several sections, so
that it may be expanded in the form of a true circle. Further tightness
is secured without undue friction by means of the packing ring
<i>P</i> which fits in a groove in <i>R</i> and is forced lightly against the walls
of the cylinder by a number of coil springs, one of which is shown at
<i>S</i>. As the cylinder and piston become worn, screws <i>A</i> are adjusted
from time to time, and the fine adjustment for tightness is cared for
by the packing ring <i>P</i> and the coil springs <i>S</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>The points to be brought out in connection with the cross-head are
the methods of alignment and adjustment. A typical cross-head is
shown in cross and longitudinal sections in <a href="#Fig31">Fig. 31</a>. Alignment in a
straight line, longitudinally, is secured by the cylindrical form of the
bearing surfaces or shoes, shown at <i>S</i>. These are sometimes made V-shaped
in order to secure the same result. The wear on a cross-head
comes on the surfaces <i>S</i>, and is taken up by the use of screw wedges
<i>W</i>, shown in the longitudinal section. As the sliding surfaces become
worn, the wedges are forced in slightly by screwing in the set-screws
and clamping them in place by means of the check-nuts.</p>

"Methods Commonly Used for Taking Up Wear in a Connecting-rod" />
<p class="caption">Figs. 32 and 33. Methods Commonly Used for Taking Up Wear in a Connecting-rod</p></div>

<p>The method commonly employed in taking up the wear in a connecting-rod
is shown in <a href="#Fig32">Figs. 32</a> and <a href="#Fig33">33</a>. The wear at the wrist-pin is
taken by the so called brasses, shown at <i>B</i> in the illustrations. The
inner brass, in both cases, fits in a suitable groove, and is held stationary
when once in place. The outer brass is adjustable, being forced
toward the wrist-pin by a sliding wedge which is operated by one or
more set-screws. In <a href="#Fig32">Fig. 32</a> the wedge is held in a vertical position,
and is adjusted by two screws as shown. The arrangement made use
of in <a href="#Fig33">Fig. 33</a> has the wedge passing through the rod in a horizontal
position, and adjusted by means of a single screw, as shown in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
lower view. With the arrangements shown, tightening up the brasses
shortens the length of the rod. In practice the wedges at each end of
the rod are so placed that tightening one shortens the rod, and tightening
the other lengthens it, the total effect being to keep the connecting-rod
at its original length.</p>

<p>A common form of outboard bearing for an engine of the slow-speed
or Corliss type is illustrated in <a href="#Fig34">Fig. 34</a>. The various adjustments for
alignment and for taking up wear are the important points considered
in this case. The plate <i>B</i> is fastened to the stone foundation by anchor
bolts not shown. Sidewise movement is secured by loosening the bolts
<i>C</i>, which pass through slots in the bearing, and adjusting by means of
the screws <i>S</i>. Vertical adjustment
is obtained by use of the
wedge <i>W</i>, which is forced in by
the screw <i>A</i>, as required. The
inner bearing and bed piece of
a heavy duty Corliss engine is
shown in <a href="#Fig35">Fig. 35</a>. The bearing
in this case is made up of four
sections, so arranged that
either horizontal or vertical adjustment
may be secured by
the use of adjusting screws
and check-nuts.</p>

<p>Engines of the slide-valve type are usually provided either with a
fly-ball throttling governor, or a shaft governor. A common form of
throttling governor is shown in <a href="#Fig36">Fig. 36</a>. As the speed increases the
balls <i>W</i> are thrown outward by the action of the centrifugal force, and
being attached to arms hinged above them, any outward movement causes
them to rise. This operates the spindle <i>S</i>, which, in turn, partially
closes the balanced valve in body <i>B</i>, thus cutting down the steam
supply delivered to the engine. The action of a throttling governor upon
the work diagram of an engine is shown in <a href="#Fig38">Fig. 38</a>. Let the full line
represent the form of the diagram with the engine working at full load.
Now, if a part of the load be thrown off, the engine will speed up
slightly, causing the governor to act as described, thus bringing the
admission and expansion lines into the lower positions, as shown in
dotted lines.</p>

<p>The shaft governor is used almost universally on high-speed engines,
and is shown in one form in <a href="#Fig37">Fig. 37</a>. It consists, in this case, of two
weights <i>W</i>, hinged to the spokes of the wheel near the
circumference<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
by means of suitable arms. Attached to the arms, as shown, are coil
springs <i>C</i>. The ends of the arms beyond the weights are connected by
means of levers <i>L</i> to the eccentric disk. When the engine speeds up,
the weights tend to swing outward toward the rim of the wheel, the
amount of the movement being regulated by the tension of the springs
<i>C</i>. As the arms move outward, the levers at the ends turn the eccentric
disk on the shaft, the effect of which is to change the angle of
advance and shorten the cut-off. When the speed falls below the normal,
the weights move toward the center and the cut-off is lengthened.
The effect of this form of governor on the diagram is shown in <a href="#Fig39">Fig. 39</a>.
The full line represents the diagram at full load, and the dotted line
when the engine is under-loaded.</p>

<h3>STEAM ENGINE ECONOMY</h3>


<p>Under the general heading of steam engine economy, such items as
cylinder condensation, steam consumption, efficiency, ratio of expansion,
under- and over-loading, condensing, etc., are treated.</p>

<p>The principal waste of steam in the operation of an engine is due to
condensation during the first part of the stroke. This condensation is
due to the fact that during expansion and exhaust the cylinder walls<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and head and the piston are in contact with comparatively cool steam,
and, therefore, give up a considerable amount of heat. When fresh
steam is admitted at a high temperature, it immediately gives up sufficient
heat to raise the cylinder walls to a temperature approximating
that of the entering steam. This results in the condensation of a certain
amount of steam, the quantity depending upon the time allowed
for the transfer of heat, the area of exposed surface, and the temperature
of the cylinder walls. During the period of expansion the temperature
falls rapidly, and the steam being wet, absorbs a large amount of
heat. After the exhaust valve opens, the drop in pressure allows the
moisture that has collected on the cylinder walls to evaporate into
steam, so that during the exhaust period but little heat is transferred.
With the admission of fresh steam at boiler pressure, a mist is condensed
on the cylinder walls, which greatly increases the rapidity with
which heat is absorbed.</p>

<p>The amount of heat lost through cylinder condensation is best shown
by a practical illustration. One horsepower is equal to 33,000 foot-pounds
of work per minute, or 33,000&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;60 = 1,980,000 foot-pounds
per hour. This is equivalent to 1,980,000&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;778 = 2,550 heat units.
The latent heat of steam at 90 pounds gage pressure is 881 heat units.
Hence, 2,250&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;881 = 2.9 pounds of steam at 90 pounds pressure is
required per horsepower, provided there is no loss of steam, and all
of the contained heat is changed into useful work. As a matter of
fact, from 30 to 35 pounds of steam are required in the average simple
non-condensing high-speed engine.</p>

<p>There are three remedies which are used to reduce the amount of
cylinder condensation. The first to be used was called steam jacketing,
and consisted in surrounding the cylinder with a layer of high-pressure
steam, the idea being to keep the inner walls up to a temperature
nearly equal to that of the incoming steam. This arrangement
is but little used at the present time, owing both to the expense
of operation and to its ineffectiveness as compared with other methods.</p>

<p>The second remedy is the use of superheated steam. It has been
stated that the transfer of heat takes place much more rapidly when
the interior surfaces are covered with a coating of moisture or mist.
Superheated steam has a temperature considerably above the point of
saturation at the given pressure; hence, it is possible to cool it a certain
amount before condensation begins. This has the effect of reducing
the transfer of heat for a short period following admission, and
this is the time that condensation takes place most rapidly under
ordinary conditions with saturated steam. This, in fact, is the principal
advantage derived from the use of superheated steam, although it
is also lighter for a given volume, and therefore, a less weight of
steam is required, to fill the cylinder up to the point of cut-off. The
economical degree of superheating is considered to be that which will
prevent the condensation of any steam on the walls of the cylinder up
to the point of cut-off, thus keeping them at all times free from moisture.
The objections to superheated steam are its cutting effect in the
passages through which it flows, and the difficulty experienced in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>lubricating
the valves and cylinder at such a high temperature. The
third and most effective remedy for condensation losses is that known
as compounding, which will be treated under a separate heading in
the following.</p>


<h3>Multiple Expansion Engines</h3>

<p>It has been explained that cylinder condensation is due principally
to the change in temperature of the interior surfaces of the cylinder,
caused by the variation in temperature of the steam at initial and exhaust
pressures. Therefore, if the temperature range be divided between
two cylinders which are operated in series, the steam condensed
in the first or high pressure cylinder will be re-evaporated and
passed into the low-pressure cylinder as steam, where it will again be
condensed and re-evaporated as it passes into the exhaust pipe. Theoretically,
this should reduce the condensation loss by one-half, and if
three cylinders are used, the loss should be only one-third of that in a
simple engine. In actual practice the saving is not as great as this,
but with the proper relation between the cylinders, these results are approximated.</p>

<p>Engines in which expansion takes place in two stages are called
compound engines. When three stages are employed, they are called
triple expansion engines. Compounding adds to the first cost of an
engine, and also to the friction, so that in determining the most economical
number of cylinders to employ, the actual relation between
the condensation loss and the increased cost of the engine and the
friction loss, must be considered. In the case of power plant work, it
is now the practice to use compound engines for the large sizes, while
triple expansion engines are more commonly employed in pumping stations.
Many designs of multiple expansion engines are provided with
chambers between the cylinders, called receivers. In engines of this
type the exhaust is frequently reheated in the receivers by means of
brass coils containing live steam. In the case of a cross-compound
engine, a receiver is always used. In the tandem design it is often
omitted, the piping between the two cylinders being made to answer
the purpose.</p>

<p>The ratio of cylinder volumes in compound engines varies with different
makers. The usual practice is to make the volume of the low-pressure
cylinder from 2.5 to 3 times that of the high-pressure. The
total ratio of expansion in a multiple expansion engine is the product
of the ratios in each cylinder. For example, if the ratio of expansion
is 4 in each cylinder in a compound engine, the total ratio will be 4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;4
= 16. The effect of a triple-expansion engine is sometimes obtained
in a measure by making the volume of the low-pressure cylinder of a
compound engine 6 or 7 times that of the high-pressure. This arrangement
produces a considerable drop in pressure at the end of the high-pressure
stroke, with the result of throwing a considerable increase
of work on the high-pressure cylinder without increasing its ratio of
expansion, and at the same time securing a large total ratio of expansion
in the engine.</p>

<p>In the case of vertical engines, the low-pressure cylinder is
sometimes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
divided into two parts in order to reduce the size of cylinder and piston.
In this arrangement a receiver of larger size than usual is employed,
and the low-pressure cranks are often set at an angle with each
other.</p>

<p>Another advantage gained by compounding is the possibility to expand
the steam to a greater extent than can be done in a single cylinder
engine, thus utilizing, as useful work, a greater proportion of the
heat contained in the steam. This also makes it possible to employ
higher initial pressures, in which there is a still further saving, because
of the comparatively small amount of fuel required to raise the
pressure from that of the common practice of 80 or 90 pounds for
simple engines, to 120 to 140 pounds, which is entirely practical in the
case of compound engines. With triple expansion, initial pressures of
180 pounds or more may be used to advantage. The gain from compounding
may amount to about 15 per cent over simple condensing
engines, taking steam at the same initial pressure. When compound
condensing engines are compared with simple non-condensing engines,
the gain in economy may run from 30 to 40 per cent.</p>

<h3>Steam Consumption and Ratio of Expansion</h3>

<p>The steam consumption is commonly called the <i>water rate</i>, and is
expressed in pounds of dry steam required per indicated horsepower
per hour. This quantity varies widely in different types of engines,
and also in engines of the same kind working under different conditions.
The water rate depends upon the &#8220;cylinder losses,&#8221; which are due principally
to condensation, although the effects of clearance, radiation
from cylinder and steam chest, and leakage around valves and piston,
form a part of the total loss. <a href="#TabIV">Table IV</a> gives the average water rate
of different types of engines working at full load.</p>

<p>The most economical ratio of expansion depends largely upon the
type of the engine. In the case of simple engines, the ratio is limited
to 4 or 5 on account of excessive cylinder condensation in case of larger
ratios. This limits the initial pressure to an average of about 90
pounds for engines of this type. In the case of compound engines, a
ratio of from 8 to 10 is commonly employed to advantage, while with
triple-expansion engines, ratios of 12 to 15 are found to give good results.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>The
<i>thermal efficiency</i> of an engine is the ratio of the heat transformed
into work to the total heat supplied to the engine. In order to
determine this, the <i>absolute</i> temperature of the steam at admission
and exhaust pressures must be known. These pressures can be measured
by a gage, and the corresponding temperatures taken from a
steam table, or better, the temperatures can be measured direct by
a thermometer. The absolute temperature is obtained by adding 461
to the reading in degrees Fahrenheit (F.). The formula for thermal
efficiency is:</p>

<p>The <i>mechanical efficiency</i> is the ratio of the delivered or brake horsepower
to the indicated horsepower, and is represented by the equation:</p>

</table>

<p>All engines are designed to give the best economy at a certain developed
indicated horsepower called full load. There must, of course,
be more or less fluctuation in the load under practical working conditions,
especially in certain cases, such as electric railway and rolling
mill work. The losses, however, within a certain range on either side
of the normal load, are not great in a well designed engine. The effect
of increasing the load is to raise the initial pressure or lengthen the
cut-off, depending upon the type of governor. This, in turn, raises the
terminal pressure at the end of expansion, and allows the exhaust to
escape at a higher temperature than before, thus lowering the thermal
efficiency.</p>

<p>The effect of reducing the load is to lower the mean effective pressure.
(See <a href="#Fig38">Figs. 38</a> and <a href="#Fig39">39</a>.) This, in throttling engines, is due to a
reduction of initial pressure, and in the automatic engine to a shortening
of the cut-off. The result in each case is an increase in cylinder
condensation, and as the load becomes lighter, the friction of the
engine itself becomes a more important part of the total indicated
horsepower; that is, as the load becomes lighter, the mechanical efficiency
is reduced.</p>


<h3>Effect of Condensing</h3>

<p>So far as the design of the engine itself it concerned, there is no
difference between a condensing and a non-condensing engine. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
only difference is that in the first case the exhaust pipe from the engine
is connected with a condenser instead of discharging into the atmosphere.</p>

<p>A condenser is a device for condensing the exhaust steam as fast as
it comes from the engine, thus forming a partial vacuum and reducing
the back pressure. The attaching of a condenser to an engine may be
made to produce two results, as shown by the work diagrams illustrated
in Figs. 40 and 41. In the first case the full line represents the
diagram of the engine when running non-condensing, and the area of
the diagram gives a measure of the work done. The effect of adding a
condenser is to reduce the back pressure on an average of 10 to 12
pounds per square inch, which is equivalent to adding the same amount
to the mean effective pressure. The effect of this on the diagram, when
the cut-off remains the same, is shown by the dotted line in Fig. 40.
The power of the engine per stroke is increased by an amount represented
by the area enclosed by the dotted line and the bottom of the
original diagram. Assuming the reduction in back pressure to be 10
pounds, which is often exceeded in the best practice, the gain in power
by running condensing will be proportional to the increase in mean
effective pressure under these conditions. For example, if the mean
effective pressure is 40 pounds when running non-condensing, it will
be increased to 40 + 10 = 50 pounds when running condensing, that
is, it is <span class="enum">50</span>&#8260;<span class="denom">40</span> = 1.25 times as great as before. Therefore, if the engine
develops 100 I. H. P. under the first condition, its final power will be
increased to 100&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;1.25 = 125 I. H. P. under the second condition.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig41">Fig. 41</a> shows the effect of adding a condenser and shortening the cut-off
to keep the area of the diagram the same as before. The result in
this case is a reduction in the quantity of steam required to develop
the same indicated horsepower. The theoretical gain in economy under
these conditions will run from about 28 to 30 per cent for simple, and
from 20 to 22 per cent for compound engines. The actual gain will
depend upon the cost and operation of the condenser which varies
greatly in different localities.</p>

<h3>TYPES OF STEAM ENGINES</h3>


<p>There are various ways of classifying steam engines according to their
construction, the most common, perhaps, being according to speed. If
this classification is employed, they may be grouped under three general
headings: High-speed, from 300 to 400 revolutions per minute;
moderate-speed, from 100 to 200 revolutions; and slow-speed, from 60
to 90 revolutions; all depending, however, upon the length of stroke.
This classification is again sub-divided according to valve mechanism,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
horizontal and vertical, simple and compound, etc. The different forms
of engines shown in the following illustrations show representative
types in common use for different purposes.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig42" id="Fig42"></a><img src="images/illo038.jpg" alt="Ball Engine" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 42. The Ball Engine</p></div>

<p>The Ball engine, as shown in <a href="#Fig42">Fig. 42</a>, is a typical horizontal single
valve high-speed engine with a direct-connected dynamo. It is very
rigid in design and especially compact for the power developed. The
valve is of the double-ported type shown in <a href="#Fig02">Fig. 2</a>, having a cover plate
for removing the steam pressure from the back of the valve. The piston
is hollow with internal ribs similar to that shown in <a href="#Fig29">Fig. 29</a>, and is
provided with spring packing rings carefully fitted in place. The governor
is of the shaft type, having only one weight instead of two, as
shown in <a href="#Fig37">Fig. 37</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig43" id="Fig43"></a><img src="images/illo039.jpg" alt="The Sturtevant Vertical Engine" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 43. The Sturtevant Vertical Engine</p></div>

<p>The Sturtevant engine shown in <a href="#Fig43">Fig. 43</a> is a vertical high-speed engine
of a form especially adapted to electrical work. Engines of this
general design are made in a variety of sizes, and are often used on
account of the small floor space required. In the matter of detail, such
as valves, governors, etc., they do not differ materially from the high-speed
horizontal engine.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig44" id="Fig44"></a><img src="images/illo040a.jpg" alt="Moderate Speed Engine of the Four-valve Type" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 44. Moderate Speed Engine of the Four-valve Type</p></div>

<p><a href="#Fig44">Fig. 44</a> illustrates a moderate-speed engine of the four-valve type.
These engines are built either with flat valves, or with positively driven
rotary or Corliss valves, the latter being used in the engine shown.
It will be noticed that the drop-lever and dash-pot arrangement is
omitted, the valves being both opened and closed by means of the
wrist-plate and its connecting rods. This arrangement is used on account
of the higher speed at which the engine is run, the regular Corliss
valve gear being limited to comparatively low speeds. All engines
of this make are provided with an automatic system of lubrication.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
The oil is pumped through a filter to a central reservoir, seen above
the center of the engine, and from here delivered to all bearings by
gravity. The pump is attached to the rocker arm, and therefore easily
accessible for repairs.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig45" id="Fig45"></a><img src="images/illo040b.jpg" alt="The Harris Corliss Engine" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 45. The Harris Corliss Engine</p></div>

<p>The standard Harris Corliss engine shown in <a href="#Fig45">Fig. 45</a>, is typical of
its class. It is provided with the girder type of frame, and with an
outboard bearing mounted upon a stone foundation. The valve gear
is of the regular Corliss type, driven by a single eccentric and wrist-plate.
The dash pots are mounted on cast-iron plates set in the floor
at the side of the engine, where they may be easily inspected. The
governor is similar in construction to the one already described, and
shown in <a href="#Fig27">Fig. 27</a>. The four engines so far described are simple engines,
the expansion taking place in a single cylinder. <a href="#Fig46">Figs. 46</a> to <a href="#Fig48">48</a>
show three different types of the compound engine.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig46" id="Fig46"></a><img src="images/illo041a.jpg" alt="The Skinner Tandem Engine" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 46. The Skinner Tandem Engine</p></div>

<p>The engine shown in <a href="#Fig46">Fig. 46</a> is of a type known as the tandem compound.
In this design the cylinders are in line, the low-pressure cylinder
in front of the high-pressure, as shown. There is only one
piston rod, the high-pressure and low-pressure pistons being mounted
on the same rod. The general appearance of an engine of this design
is the same as a simple engine, except for the addition of the high-pressure
cylinder. The governor is of the shaft type and operates by
changing the cut-off in the high-pressure cylinder. The cut-off in the
low pressure cylinder is adjusted by hand to divide the load equally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
between the two cylinders for the normal load which the engine is to
carry.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig47" id="Fig47"></a><img src="images/illo041b.jpg" alt="American Ball Duplex Compound Engine" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 47. American Ball Duplex Compound Engine</p></div>

<p>The engine shown in <a href="#Fig47">Fig. 47</a> is known as a duplex compound. In
this design the high-pressure cylinder is placed directly below the low-pressure
cylinder, as indicated, and both piston rods are attached to
the same cross-head. The remainder of the engine is practically the
same as a simple engine of the same type.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig48" id="Fig48"></a><img src="images/illo042.jpg" alt="The Monarch Corliss Engine" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 48. The Monarch Corliss Engine</p></div>

<p><a href="#Fig48">Fig. 48</a> shows a cross-compound engine of heavy design, built especially
for rolling mill work. In this arrangement two complete engines
are used, except for the main shaft and flywheel, which are common
to both. The engine is so piped that the high-pressure cylinder
exhausts into the low-pressure, through a receiver, the connection being
under the floor and not shown in the illustration. One of the advantages
of the cross-compound engine over other forms is that the cranks
may be set 90 degrees apart, so that when one is on a dead center the
other is approximately at its position of greatest effort.</p>

<h3>Selection of an Engine</h3>

<p>The selection of an engine depends upon a number of conditions
which vary to a considerable extent in different cases. Among these
may be mentioned first cost, size and character of plant, available
space, steam economy, and utilization of the exhaust steam. The
question of first cost is usually considered in connection with that of
operation, and items such as interest and depreciation are compared
with the saving made through the saving in steam with high priced
engines.</p>

<p>The principal use of the stationary engine is confined to the driving
of electric generators and the furnishing of motive power in shops
and factories. For the first of these uses, in cases where floor space is
limited, as in office buildings, and where the power does not exceed
about 100 I. H. P., the simple non-condensing high-speed engine is
probably employed more than any other type. For larger installations,
a saving may usually be made by the substitution of the moderate-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>speed
four-valve engine. The question of simple and compound engines
in this class of work depends largely upon the use made of the
exhaust steam. In winter time the exhaust is nearly always utilized
in the heating system, hence steam economy is not of great importance,
and the simple engine answers all purposes at a smaller first cost.
In localities where the heating season is comparatively short and
fuel high, there is a decided advantage in using compound engines on
account of their greater steam economy when operated within their
economical range as regards load.</p>

<p>In large central plants where low cost of operation is always of
first importance, it is common practice to use the best class of compound
condensing engines of moderate or low speed. Those equipped
with some form of Corliss valve gear are frequently found in this class
of work. In the generation of power for shops and factories, where
there is plenty of floor space, low-speed engines of the Corliss type are
most commonly used. When space is limited, very satisfactory results
may be obtained by using the moderate-speed four-valve engine. In
deciding upon an engine for any particular case, the problem must be
studied from all sides, and one be chosen which best answers the greatest
number of requirements.</p>

<h3>STEAM ENGINE TESTING</h3>


<p>The principal information sought in the usual test of a steam engine
is:</p>

<p>1. The indicated horsepower developed under certain standard conditions.</p>

<p>2. The friction of the engine, from which is determined the mechanical
efficiency.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>3. The steam consumption per indicated horsepower.</p>

<p>4. The general action of the valves.</p>

<p>5. The pressure conditions in the cylinder at different periods of
the stroke.</p>

<p>The ultimate object of an efficiency test is to determine the foot-pounds
of work delivered by the engine per pound of coal burned in the
boiler furnaces. The general method of finding the pounds of dry steam
evaporated per pound of coal has been treated in <span class="smcap">Machinery&#8217;s</span> Reference
Series No. 67, &#8220;Boilers,&#8221; under the head of &#8220;Boiler Testing.&#8221; In
the present case it is, therefore, only necessary to carry the process a
step further and determine the foot-pounds of work developed per
pound of steam.</p>

<p>The apparatus used in engine testing, in addition to that used in
boiler testing, consists of a steam engine <i>indicator</i> and reducing device
for taking diagrams, and a <i>planimeter</i> for measuring them afterwards.
If the test is made independently of the boiler test, a calorimeter for
measuring the amount of moisture in the steam should be added to the
outfit.</p>

<p>It has already been shown how a diagram may be made to represent
graphically the work done in a steam engine cylinder during one
stroke of the piston. The diagrams shown thus far have been theoretical
or ideal cards constructed from assumed relations of the pressure
acting and the distance moved through by the piston. An indicator
is a device for making a diagram of what actually takes place in an
engine cylinder under working conditions. Such a diagram shows
the points of admission, cut-off, and release, and indicates accurately
the pressures acting upon both sides of the piston at all points of the
stroke.</p>

<div class="figleft"><a name="Fig49" id="Fig49"></a><img src="images/illo044.png" alt="Steam Engine Indicator" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 49. Steam Engine Indicator</p></div>

<p>A common form of steam engine indicator is shown in <a href="#Fig49">Fig. 49</a>. It
consists of a cylinder <i>C</i> which is placed in communication at <i>E</i> with
one end of the engine cylinder by a proper pipe connection, provided
with a quick opening and closing cock or valve. The cylinder <i>C</i>
contains a piston, above which is placed a coil spring of such strength
that a given pressure per square inch acting upon the lower side of the
piston will compress the spring a definite and known amount. Extending
through the cap or head of cylinder <i>C</i> is a stem attached to the
piston below, and connected by suitable levers with a pencil point <i>P</i>.
The arrangement of the levers is such that a certain rise of the piston
causes the point <i>P</i> to move upward in a vertical line a proportional
amount.</p>

<p>The springs used above the piston vary in strength, and are designated
as 20-pound, 40-pound, 60-pound, etc. A 20-pound spring is of
such strength that a pressure of 20 pounds per square inch, acting beneath
the piston in cylinder <i>C</i>, will raise the pencil point 1 inch. With
a 40-pound spring, a pressure of 40 pounds per square inch will be
required to raise the pencil 1 inch, and so on for the other strengths
of spring.</p>

<p>The hollow drum <i>D</i> rotates back and forth upon a vertical stem at
its center, its motion being produced by the string <i>H</i>, which is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>attached
by means of a suitable reducing motion to the cross-head of
the engine. The return motion to the drum is obtained from a coil
spring contained within it and not shown. The paper upon which the
diagram is to be drawn is wound around the drum <i>D</i>, and held in place
by the spring clip <i>F</i>.</p>

<p>In taking an indicator card, the length of stroke must be reduced
to come within the limits of the drum, that is, it must be somewhat
less than the circumference of drum <i>D</i>. In practice, the diagram is
commonly made from 3 to 4 inches in length. There are a number
of devices in use for reproducing the stroke of the engine on a smaller
scale. The most accurate consists of a series of pulleys over which the
cord passes on its way from the cross-head to the indicator drum.</p>

<p>The indicator is connected
with the engine cylinder
by means of special
openings tapped close to
the heads and either
plugged or closed by means
of stop-cocks when not in
use. In some cases two indicators
are used, one being
connected to each end
of the cylinder, while in
others a single indicator is
made to answer the purpose
by being so piped that
it can be connected with
either end by means of a
three-way cock. After the
indicator is connected and
the cord adjusted to give
the proper motion to the
drum, a card is attached,
after which the three-way cock is opened and steam allowed to blow
through the indicator to warm it up. The cock is now closed and the
pencil pressed against the drum to get the so-called atmospheric line.
The cock is again opened, and the pencil pressed lightly against the
drum during one complete revolution of the engine. The cock is
then thrown over to connect the indicator with the other end of the
cylinder and the operation is repeated.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig50" id="Fig50"></a><img src="images/illo045.png" alt="A Typical Indicator Diagram" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 50. A Typical Indicator Diagram</p></div>

<p>The indicator card obtained in this way is shown in <a href="#Fig50">Fig. 50</a>. It is
sometimes preferred to take the diagrams of the two ends on separate
cards, but it is simpler to take them both on the same one, and also
easier to compare the working of the two ends of the cylinder.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig51" id="Fig51"></a><img src="images/illo046.png" alt="Diagram for Illustrating Method of Computation" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 51. Diagram for Illustrating Method of Computation</p></div>

<p>The analysis of a card for practical purposes is shown in <a href="#Fig51">Fig. 51</a>.
Suppose, for example, that the length of the diagram measures 3.6
inches; the distance to the point of cut-off is 1.2 inch; and the distance
to the point of release is 3.3 inches. Then, by dividing 1.2 by 3.6, the
cut-off is found to occur at 1.2&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;3.6 = <span class="enum">1</span>&#8260;<span class="denom">3</span>
of the stroke. Release<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
occurs at 3.3&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;3.6 = 0.92 of the stroke. Compression begins at
(3.6 - 0.5)&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;3.6 = 0.86 of the stroke. The diagrams shown in <a href="#Fig50">Figs. 50</a>
and <a href="#Fig51">51</a> are from non-condensing engines, and the back-pressure line is
therefore above the atmospheric line, as indicated.</p>

<p>The indicator diagram gives a means of determining the mean effective
pressure, from which the power of the engine can be found
from the previously given equation</p>

<table class="formula" summary="Formula p44">

<td>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.</td>

<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>

</tr>

</table>

<p>The method of determining the mean effective pressure is as follows:
First measure the area of the card in square inches, by means of a
planimeter (an instrument described later), and divide this area by
the length in inches. This gives the mean ordinate; the mean ordinate,
in turn, multiplied by the strength of spring used, will give the
mean effective pressure in pounds per square inch. For example, suppose
that the card shown in <a href="#Fig51">Fig. 51</a> is taken with a 60-pound spring,
and that the area, as measured by a planimeter, is found to be 2.6
square inches. Dividing the area by the length gives 2.6&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;3.6 =
0.722 inch as the mean ordinate, and this multiplied by the strength
of spring gives a mean effective pressure of 0.722&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;60 = 43.3 pounds
per square inch.</p>

<p>In practice, diagrams taken from the two ends of the cylinder usually
vary more or less, due to inequalities in the valve action. Again,
the effective area of the piston on the crank end is less than that on
the head end, by an amount equal to the area of the piston rod. For
these reasons it is customary to compute the mean effective pressure
of all the cards separately, and take, for use in the formula, the average
of the various computations. The corrected value of the piston
area is, as already stated, equal to <span class="enum">(2<i>A</i> - <i>a</i>)</span>&#8260;<span class="denom">2</span>,
in which <i>A</i> is the area
of the piston, and <i>a</i> the area of the piston rod. Substituting these
values for <i>A</i> and <i>P</i> in the formula, together with the length of stroke
and average number of revolutions per minute, the indicated horsepower
is easily computed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>In making an ordinary test, diagrams are taken from both ends of
the cylinder at 10-minute intervals for several hours, depending upon
the accuracy required. The revolutions of the engine are counted for
two or three-minute periods each time a pair of cards are taken, or
still better, an automatic counter is used for the run, from which the
average number of revolutions per minute may be determined.</p>

<p>The friction of the engine is determined by taking a pair of cards
while &#8220;running light,&#8221; that is, with the belt thrown off, or the engine
uncoupled, from the dynamo, if part of a direct-connected outfit. The
friction load is then computed in horsepower from the indicator cards,
and subtracted from the indicated horsepower when loaded. Thus we
obtain the delivered or brake horsepower. The delivered horsepower
divided by the indicated horsepower gives the mechanical efficiency.
This may be expressed in the form of an equation as follows:</p>

<h3>Planimeter</h3>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig52" id="Fig52"></a><img src="images/illo047.png" alt="General Construction of Planimeter" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 52. General Construction of Planimeter</p></div>

<p>The planimeter is an instrument for measuring areas in general, and
especially for measuring the areas of indicator cards. Some forms
give the mean effective pressure directly, without computations, by
changing the scale to correspond with the spring used in the indicator.
A planimeter of this type is shown in <a href="#Fig52">Fig. 52</a>. The method of manipulating
this instrument is as follows. Set the arm <i>BD</i> equal to the
length of the card <i>EF</i>, by means of the thumb screw <i>S</i>, and set the
wheel at zero on the scale, which must correspond to the spring used
in the indicator. Next, place the point <i>D</i> at about the middle of the
area to be measured, and set point <i>C</i> so that the arm <i>CB</i> shall be approximately
at right angles with <i>BD</i>. Then move <i>D</i> to the upper left-hand
corner of the diagram, and with the left hand move <i>C</i> either to
the right or left until the wheel comes back exactly to the zero point
on the scale; then press the point firmly into the paper. Now, go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
around the outline of the diagram with point <i>D</i> from left to right, finishing
exactly at the starting point. The mean effective pressure may
now be read from the scale opposite the edge of the wheel.</p>

<p>When very accurate results are required, the tracer point <i>D</i> may be
passed over the diagram several times, and the reading divided by the
number of times it is thus passed around. With short cards, 3 inches
and under in length, it is best to make the arm <i>BD</i> twice the length
of the card, and go around the diagram twice, taking the reading directly
from the scale as in the first case.</p>


<h3>Determining Steam Consumption</h3>

<p>When it is desired to determine accurately the water rate of an
engine, a boiler test should be carried on simultaneously with the test
upon the engine, from which the pounds of dry steam supplied may be
determined as described in <span class="smcap">Machinery&#8217;s</span> Reference Series No. 67,
&#8220;Boilers.&#8221; Knowing the average weight of steam supplied per hour
for the run, and the average indicated horsepower developed during
the same period, the water rate of the engine is easily computed. Sometimes
the average cylinder condensation for a given type and make is
known for certain standard conditions. In this case an approximation
may be made from an indicator diagram which represents the
average operation of the engine during the test.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig53" id="Fig53"></a><img src="images/illo048.png" alt="Diagram for Calculating Steam Consumption" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 53. Diagram for Calculating Steam Consumption</p></div>

<p>A diagram shows by direct measurement the pressure and volume
at any point of the stroke, and the weight of steam per cubic foot for
any given pressure may be taken directly from a steam table. The
method, then, of finding the weight of steam at any point in the stroke
is to find the volume in cubic feet, including the clearance and piston
displacement to the given point, which must be taken at cut-off or
later, and to multiply this by the weight per cubic foot corresponding
to the pressure at the given point measured on the diagram. As this
includes the steam used for compression, it must be corrected, as follows,
to obtain the actual weight used per stroke. Take some con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>venient
point on the compression curve, as <i>Q</i>, in <a href="#Fig53">Fig. 53</a>; measure its
absolute pressure from the vacuum line <i>OX</i> and compute the weight
of steam to this point. Subtract this weight from that computed above
for the given point on the expansion line, and the result will be the
weight of steam used per stroke. The best point on the expansion line
to use for this purpose is just before release, both because the maximum
amount of leakage has taken place, and also because of the re-evaporation
of a portion of the steam condensed during admission. The actual
computation of the steam consumption from an indicator diagram is
best shown by a practical illustration.</p>

<p><i>Example</i>&mdash;Let <a href="#Fig53">Fig. 53</a> represent a diagram taken from the head
end of a 16&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;30-inch non-condensing engine, running at a speed of 150
revolutions per minute; the card is taken with a 60-pound spring; the
clearance of the engine is 6 per cent; the average cylinder condensation
is 20 per cent of the total steam consumption; the diameter of the
piston rod is 3 inches.</p>

<p>Measuring the card with a planimeter shows the mean effective pressure
to be 48.2 pounds. The area of the piston is 201 square inches;
the area of the piston rod is 7 square inches; hence, the average piston
area = <span class="enum">(2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;201) - 7</span>&#8260;<span class="denom">2</span>
= 198 square inches, approximately. Then</p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig53">Fig. 53</a>, <i>GH</i> is the atmospheric line; <i>OX</i> is the line of vacuum or
zero pressure, drawn so that <i>GO</i> = 14.7 pounds on the scale; and <i>OY</i>
is the clearance line, so drawn that <i>ON</i> = 0.06 <i>NX</i>. The line <i>PQ</i> is
drawn from <i>OX</i> to some point on the compression line, as at <i>Q</i>. From
<i>C</i>, a point on the expansion line, just before release, the line <i>CF</i> is
drawn perpendicular to <i>OX</i>. The following dimensions are now carefully
measured from the actual diagram (not the one shown in the illustration),
with the results given:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>On the indicator diagram, being taken with a 60-pound spring, all
vertical distances represent pounds per square inch, in the ratio of 60
pounds per inch of height. The stroke of the engine is 30 inches or 2.5
feet. The length of the diagram <i>NX</i> is 3.5 inches; hence, each inch in
length represents <span class="enum">2.5</span>&#8260;<span class="denom">3.5</span> = 0.71 feet. From the above it is evident that
vertical distances in <a href="#Fig53">Fig. 53</a> must be multiplied by 60 to reduce them
to pounds pressure per square inch, and that horizontal distances must
be multiplied by 0.71 to reduce them to feet. Making these reductions
gives:</p>

<table summary="Table p48-2">

</tr>

</table>

<p>As a card from the head end of the cylinder is taken to avoid corrections
for the piston rod, the area is 201 square inches or 1.4 square foot.
With the above data the volume and weight of the steam in the cylinder
can be computed at any point in the stroke. When the piston is at <i>C</i>,
the volume is 1.4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;2.27 = 3.18 cubic feet. When the piston is at <i>Q</i>,
the volume is 1.4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;0.30 = 0.42 cubic foot. From a steam table the
weight of a cubic foot of steam at 48.6 pounds absolute pressure is
found to be 0.116 pounds. Therefore, the weight of steam present when
the piston is at <i>C</i> is 3.18&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;0.116 = 0.369 pounds. The weight of steam
present when the piston is at <i>Q</i> is 0.42&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;0.116 = 0.049 pound. That is
the weight of steam in the cylinder at release is 0.369 pound, and the
weight kept at exhaust closure for compression is 0.049 pound.</p>

<p>The weight exhausted per stroke is therefore 0.369 - 0.049 = 0.32
pound. The number of strokes per hour is 150&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;60 = 18,000,
from which the steam accounted for by the diagram is found to be 18,000&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;0.32
= 5760 pounds, or 5760&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;217 = 26.5 pounds per indicated horsepower
per hour. If the cylinder condensation for this type of engine is
20 per cent of the total steam consumption, the water rate will be 26.5&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;0.8
= 33.1 pounds per indicated horsepower per hour.</p>

<p>In the present case it has been assumed, for simplicity, that the
head- and crank-end diagrams were exactly alike, except for the piston
rod. Ordinarily, the above process should be carried out for both head
and crank ends, and the results averaged.</p>
